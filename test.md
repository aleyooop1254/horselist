Biggie watches Leonardo and Odie leave the castle with armfuls of painting supplies, and plays a bongo signal to alert Itchy. Itchy rushes up and Biggie relays his message, but Itchy states he wouldn't rule for long, because Leonardo only paints small pictures. Biggie says he will kill Leonardo and follows him.

Biggie disguises himself as a French painter and comes up to Leonardo, asking if he's like to see a beautiful spot to paint. Leonardo agrees, so Biggie leads him up to a high mountain slope with a beautiful scene. However, the scene is merely a tarp, and it rips when Leonardo and Odie step onto it.

Biggie steals the crown while Leonardo begs for Odie to do something. Meanwhile, back at the castle, Itchy crowns himself King and Biggie holds the castle staff at gunpoint to cheer about it.
> Itchy tells the people that Leonardo "fell for art" - and while they don't know that Itchy doesn't mean this metaphorically, Itchy is literally admitting to KILLING LEONARDO.

Itchy tries to read the court a poem, but instead Biggie forces him to read a decree that makes Biggie the royal treasurer. Back over the cliffside, Odie lands himself and Leonardo into an aerie. Odie realizes they can't go up or down, and realizes they need to paint an SOS sign to get out. Leonardo protests, but does lift Odie so that he can do it.

Meanwhile, back in the treasury, Biggie is getting off at the amount of money in front of him. He is disrupted by the sound of someone trying to shoo someone off.
> I think it's Itchy but i can't say for certain

Leonardo stomps up to Itchy and demands his crown back. Itchy protests, Leonardo protests his protest, and Biggie says that he's a disguised fake. Odie gives the royal mane a tug to show it's real. Hurts Leo. Leonardo orders the guards to kick Biggie and Itchy out, and while Biggie tries to let the guards in on the deal, they're booted out anyway--directly into the moat. Now that Biggie has seen the treasury, he is determined to get back there.

The next day, Leonardo receives a letter from America that says that the Bongo Congo bongos have no tone. Leonardo frets that if America quits buying their bongos, the country will die. Odie suggests they test the drums while Biggie and Itchy, disguised, listen outside. Odie calls on these two "merchants" to test their drums. Sure enough, when Leonardo plays them, they're toneless.

Odie suggests the King take the merchants to the Royal Music Chamber to hear the tone of the Master Bongo. Odie stays in the throne room. Leonardo does so, and while Itchy thinks it's cool, all Biggie thinks about is playing another signal on his drums to summon his men.
> which he has i guess?

Itchy plays the signal with all his might, but no matter how hard he tries, Biggie's backup doesn't appear. Meanwhile on the castle roof, Biggie's backup emerge from the bongos they've hidden in, and rush off the castle and into the moat. Biggie and Itchy watch this happen and wonder, while Odie laughs at them and explains that he figured the bongos sounded poor because of something inside them.

Itchy and Biggie prepare to beat Odie's ass, but Leonardo is faster to call the guards. While running from the guards, Biggie and Itchy trip over their bongos and roll out of the castle. Now that that's sorted, Leonardo realizes that the letter was a forgery. Leonardo thanks Odie while Odie fluffs the pillow on his throne, urging him to sit. Leonardo refuses, seeing as it's now full of fleas. Biggie and Itchy lick their wounds on a pile of drums.
